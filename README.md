# course_copy
this is my script for copying content into from one canvas course to another, I work for a university and faculty were given dev shells to build out content and then blank live sections were created based on SIS Data. Faculty were given an excel document of live sections to verify which dev shells content was being copied from. this script takes the .csv file and based on the columns copies content from one to another.

This script retrieves a number of items stored in my environmental variables such as url, database password and username, auth token etc.
